# Portfolio Project
This project represents Version 1.0 of my web development portfolio. The site will be maintained and updated througout the next six months as more projects are completed and deployed.

The following tasks were accomplished in Version 1.0:
* Presentation of developer's name, a recent photo, and links to sections about me, my work, and how to contact me.
* Links in the navigation menu connect to relevant sections on the page.
* The first application in the serious of five placeholder images is larger than the other four. All five are are styled with the hover selector.
* Placeholder images are clickable links that will eventually lead the user to my completed projects.
* Repsonsive design allows for ease of use in a variety of screen sizes.
